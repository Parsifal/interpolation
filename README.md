# Interpolation

In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, interpolation is a type of estimation, a method of constructing new
data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points.

In engineering and science, one often has a number of data points, obtained by sampling or experimentation, which
represent the values of a function for a limited number of values of the independent variable. It is often required to
interpolate, i.e., estimate the value of that function for an intermediate value of the independent variable.

A closely related problem is the approximation of a complicated function by a simple function. Suppose the formula for
some given function is known, but too complicated to evaluate efficiently. A few data points from the original function
can be interpolated to produce a simpler function which is still fairly close to the original. The resulting gain in
simplicity may outweigh the loss from interpolation error.

    An interpolation of a finite set of points on an epitrochoid. The points in red are connected by blue interpolated spline
    curves deduced only from the red points. The interpolated curves have polynomial formulas much simpler than that of the
    original epitrochoid curve.
